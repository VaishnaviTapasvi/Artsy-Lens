<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<p>We at The Designer’s Class (“we”, “us”) want you to understand how we collect, use, and share data about you. This Privacy Policy covers our data collection practices and describes your rights to access, correct, or restrict our use of your personal data.</p>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You shouldn’t use the Services if you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or any other agreement that governs your use of the Services </p>
<h2>1.What Data We Get </h2>
<p>1.1 Data You Provide to Us </p>
<p>1.1.1 We collect certain data from you directly, like information you provide to us yourself, data about your consumption of content, and data from third-party platforms you connect with us. We also collect some data automatically, like information about your device and what parts of our Services you interact with or spend time using.  </p>
<p>1.1.2 We may collect different data from or about you depending on how you use the Services. A few illustrations of the same are as follows: </p>
<p>1.your email address</p> 
<p>2.your phone number;</p>
<p>3.your photograph;</p>
<p>4.your social media profile information;</p>
<h2>2.How We Get Data About You</h2>
<p>We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.</p>
<p>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</p>
<p>We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including us. They allow us to remember things about your visits to us, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use.</p>
<p>We and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, “Data Collection Tools“) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>3.What We Use Your Data For</h2>
<p>We use your data to do things like provide our Services, communicate with you, troubleshoot issues, secure against fraud and abuse, improve and update our Services, analyze how people use our Services, serve personalized advertising, and as required by law or necessary for safety and integrity.</p>
<p>3.1 We use the data we collect through your use of the Services to:<p>
<p>1.Provide and administer the Services, including to facilitate participation in educational content, issue completion certificates, display customized content, and facilitate communication with other users;</p>
<p>2.Process payments to instructors and other third parties;<p>
<p>3.Process your requests and orders for educational content, products, specific services, information, or features;</p>
<p>4.Communicate with you about your account by:<p>
<p>5.Responding to your questions and concerns;<p>
<p>As required or permitted by law; or
As we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.</p>
<h2>4. Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
<p>We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, our affiliates, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent. We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>4.1 With Your Instructors: We share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for educational content you access or request information about, so they can improve their content for you and other students. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to us and your activities. If we collect additional data about you (like age or gender), we may share that too. We will not share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants.</p>
<p>4.2 With Other Students and Instructors: Depending on your settings, your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable.
<p>4.4 With our Affiliates: We may share your data within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control to enable or support us in providing the Services.
<p>4.5 With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services: As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data , or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.</p>
<p>4.6 To Power Social Media Features: The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.
<p>4.7 To Administer Promotions and Surveys: We may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.
<p>4.8 For Advertising: If we decide to use an advertising-supported revenue model in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools, to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioural advertising), and to undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.</p>
<p>4.9 With Your Permission: With your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>5.Security</h2>
<p>We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.</p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications with us, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact us with any concerns.
<h2>6.Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.
<p>To stop receiving promotional communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the promotional communication you receive or by changing the email preferences in your account. Note that regardless of your email preference settings, we will send you transactional and relationship messages regarding the Services, including administrative confirmations, order confirmations, important updates about the Services, and notices about our policies.</p>
<h2>7.Updates & Contact Info</h2>
<p>When we make a material change to this policy, we’ll notify users via email, in-product notice, or another mechanism required by law. Changes become effective the day they’re posted. Please contact us via email with any questions, concerns, or disputes.</p>
<p>7.1 Modifications to This Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. If we make any material change to it, we will notify you via email or as required by applicable law. We will also include a summary of the key changes. 
As permitted by applicable law, if you continue to use the Services after the effective date of any change, then your access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of (and agreement to follow and be bound by) the revised Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy supersedes all previous Privacy Policies.</p>
